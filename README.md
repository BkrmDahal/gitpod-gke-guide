# Running Gitpod in [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)

## Provision a GKE cluster

Before starting the installation process, you need:

- A GCP account with Administrator access
  - [Create one now by clicking here](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial)
- GCP credentials set up. Install [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- A `.env` file with basic details about the environment.
  - We provide an example of such file [here](.env.example).
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your machine, or better, a Gitpod workspace :)

**To start the installation, execute:**

```shell
make install
```

The whole process takes around twenty minutes. In the end, the following resources are created:

- a GKE cluster running Kubernetes v1.21 ([rapid channel](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes-rapid)).
- GCP L4 load balancer.
- Cloud SQL - Mysql database.
- Cloud DNS zone.
- In-cluster docker registry using [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) as storage backend.
- [calico](https://docs.projectcalico.org) as CNI and NetworkPolicy implementation.
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) for self-signed SSL certificates.
- [Jaeger operator](https://github.com/jaegertracing/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/jaeger-operator) - and Jaeger deployment for gitpod distributed tracing.
- [gitpod.io](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod) deployment.

## Verify the installation

First, check that Gitpod components are running.

```shell
kubectl get pods
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

### Test Gitpod workspaces

When the provisioning and configuration of the cluster is done, the script shows the URL of the load balancer,
like:

```shell
Load balancer IP address: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
```

Please open the URL `https://<domain>/workspaces`.
It should display the gitpod login page similar to the next image.

*DNS propagation* can take several minutes.

## Update Gitpod auth providers

Please check the [OAuth providers integration documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/self-hosted/0.5.0/install/oauth) expected format.

We provide an [example here](./auth-providers-patch.yaml). Fill it with your OAuth providers data.

```console
make auth
```

> We are aware of the limitation of this approach, and we are working to improve the helm chart to avoid this step.

## Destroy the cluster and GCP resources

Remove the GCP cluster running:

```shell
make uninstall
```

> The command asks for a confirmation:
> `Are you sure you want to delete: Gitpod (y/n)?`

> Please make sure you delete the GCP buckets used to store the docker registry images and Cloud SQL database!
